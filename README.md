# Owais' Digital Garden

A [collection](https://desertthunder.github.io/garden) of notes, thoughts, and learnings on programming, philosophy, psychology, and more.
This digital garden is my attempt to contribute to the personal web and share knowledge that might resonate with others.

## About Digital Gardens

Digital gardens are personal knowledge bases that grow organically over time.
Unlike blogs with reverse-chronological posts, gardens are meant to be explored, with notes that evolve and interconnect,
similar to how we [learn](https://desertthunder.github.io/garden/writing/book-ahrens-2017/).
