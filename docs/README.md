title: About This Site

Hi! My name is Owais and this is my digital garden. It's a collection of notes
I've taken on topics that interest me. This includes a lot of engineering and
programming notes that I've taken throughout my career and while working on
personal projects. My hope is that someone learns something new or finds some
wisdom that resonates with them.

Digital gardens have been fascinating for me for a long time. I miss the days
of stumbling upon information on an odd personal site on the internet and want
to be a part of bringing that back. I've tried keeping gardens in various iterations
with tools like notion and even google drive, but nothing has been quite as
consistent as a combination of some plaintext editor (VSCode & now Neovim)
or "Knowledge IDE" like Obsidian.
