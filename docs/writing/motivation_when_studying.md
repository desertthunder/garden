title: Motivation when Studying
---

- Students fail when they are not motivated
    - When they don't see the meaning in their work[^1]
    - When they can't connect it to their goals[^2]
    - When they lack [[Autonomy in Work|freedom]]

- Motivation comes best from enjoying your work
    - Turn the writing everything and thinking about process in to a hobby
        - The book says artists and scientists are essentially information hobbyists.
        - Think Rivers Cuomo
