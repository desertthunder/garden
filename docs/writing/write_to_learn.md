title: Write to Learn
---

- When you write as you learn, you create a tangible outcome out of what you've read.[^ref]
- I think what inhibits me is that I want everything to be perfect and pristine,
when in reality it's the substance that matters. Notes can be messy and disorganized,
so long as you understand what you're putting in your brain.
    - Write down *anything* you think is helpful to understanding or need to remember
    - When you process, then you can create perfection (the structure is important)
