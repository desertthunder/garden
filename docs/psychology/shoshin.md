# Shoshin

Defined as having an attitude of openness and eagerness without pre-conceptions when
studying at a subject at an advanced level, like a beginner would or should

- The more you know about a subject, the more likely you are to be close minded about
  new information, i.e. intellectual hubris
  - Santiago Ramón y Cajal was maligned for saying that adults don't grow new neurons
  - Alfred Wegener said the Earth's crust is made up of shifting plates
  - Research is mounting that GMO's are safe[^1] (Anti-GMO folks are more likely
    to be out of date in their knowledge)
- Humility makes us behave less brazenly and be more empathetic.
- Combat this by "\[making\] the effort to explain a relevant issue or topic to yourself
    or someone else in detail, either out loud or in writing,"[^2] i.e. a sequential
    manner where you make an effort to fill in gaps.
- Challenge your ideas (how am I wrong?) and acknowledge that confirmation bias exists
- Growth mindset theory:[^3] intelligence is malleable
- Increase open-mindedness by remaining in awe of things

    One who never experiences awe ceases to discover.
