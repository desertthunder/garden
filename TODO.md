# TODO

- [ ] See [this](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/annotations/)
and implement for references.
- [ ] Implement an [rss feed](https://github.com/Guts/mkdocs-rss-plugin).
- [x] Either fix or remove the roamlinks plugin
    - leaning towards removal as it leads to a validation error by the loaded yaml schema.
