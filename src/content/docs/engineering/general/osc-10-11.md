title: OSC10 & 11
---



OSC (Operating System Commands) 10 and 11 are terminal escape sequences used to get or set the terminal’s default foreground and background colors.

In xterm’s control sequence documentation, OSC 10 and 11 are "dynamic color" commands:

- OSC 10: default text (foreground) color
- OSC 11: default background color

They support both setting and querying.

One of Ghostty's [reporting formats](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference#osc-color-report-format) for OSC 10/11 queries is rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB

- 16-bit per channel hex numbers (scaled up)
