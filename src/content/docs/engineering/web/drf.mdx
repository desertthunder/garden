title: DRF | Django REST Framework

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The de-facto standard for building REST APIs with Django. Also known as *DRF*.

## Viewsets

- A viewset[^1] is DRF's version of a controller (Rails style)

## Serializers

<Aside type="note" title="Definition">
    Serializers[^2] allow complex data such as querysets and model instances to be
    converted to native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into
    JSON, XML or other content types. Serializers also provide deserialization,
    allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types, after first
    validating the incoming data.
</Aside>

- Hyperlinked Fields[^2] use a lookup_field attribute (found in `Meta.extra_kwargs`).
It defaults to pk.
- The DRF docs advise that you leverage repr on the HyperlinkedModelSerializer
class in the django shell.
