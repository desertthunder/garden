title: Batterie's Included
---

- Web frameworks like Django & Rails are powerful because they remove the
overhead required to bootstrap a web application (database connection, security,
responses, etc.)
- Batteries included[^1] in Django's case gives us everything rails does (user
authentication, testing, database models, forms, urls)
