- Morality is how we think we should behave on earth

<Aside type="tip" title="Ethical Dilemma? Ask yourself..." icon='star'>
    1. What are we doing?
    2. Why are we doing it?
    3. Is there something we could do that’s better?
    4. Why is it better?
</Aside>

Everything has an ethical undercurrent and everything we do affects somebody

Failure in trying to do the right thing is inevitable
    - But trying means we care

Virtue ethics - what makes a person good or bad?
    - [Aristotle](/garden/philosophy/aristotle-problem) wrestled with this

Brilliant instructors and wise friends are very important

The Golden mean/goldilocks rule is that there is a spectrum that is like a see saw for virtues. If we veer to far towards one extreme, the see saw becomes imbalanced.
    - *ex.* Mildness is the golden mean of anger
    - Very challenging to define

An excess of a virtue can harm the people around you

If we don't take stock of our virtues, we can find ourselves moving towards extremes and these aspects can "calcify."

As you practice, it becomes effortless - Schur talks about how Steve Carrell & Amy Poehler were like that with their comedy

The closer we get to a golden mean, the easier it is to find others.
    - Examples include kindness and generosity

Religious zealots ignore cruelty as it is not a slight against god

Knowledge is how we escape cruelty

    With enough work, no one is doomed to be forever deprived of magnanimity or courage or any other desirable quality,
