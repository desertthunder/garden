title: Aristotle's Problem Domain
---

Aristotle's problem domain was trying to define[^1] what makes a person good:

1. What **qualities** they ought to have?
2. How much should they have?
3. Is everyone capable of having them?
4. How do we get them?
5. What does having them look like?

- The end goal is happiness (eudaimonia/flourishing)
    - To do so we need virtues (things that make us good at being human)
- We're born with potential to get virtues
    - And a natural aptitude towards some
    - We become virtuous by doing virtuous things (habitual)
