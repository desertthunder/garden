title: The Trolley Problem
---

- The problems arise when circumstances change
    - What if we're at a station with the lever and don't have the same amount of information?
    - What if we know someone on the tracks?
    - What if we push someone over a bridge to slow down the train and save everyone on the tracks?
- Utilitarianism
    - Branch of consequentialism (only thing that matters is results)
    - The best action is what makes people the most happy (greatest happiness principle)
    - Developed by British philosophers Bentham (wanted himself studied and preserved after death) and Mill (had a rough childhood
- [Bentham's Scale](./bentham-scale.md) is a way to quantify pleasure & pain (hedons & dolors - happiness points & sadness demerits)
- Utilitarians believe all people's happiness matters equally
- Correlation does not imply causation
    - Humans don't often know the consequences of their actions
- Most human actions don't have all the information - before or after
- Critiques of utilitarianism center on the wide differences between everybody's pleasure and pain
- When our actions can cause pain and suffering as a result, utilitarianism fails to take into account our integrity
    - Advantage of utilitarianism is a straightforward distribution (those in need get the most)
