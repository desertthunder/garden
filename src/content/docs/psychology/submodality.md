title: Submodalities
---


- A submodality[^1] is a distinction in how we re-experience a past event.
    - *Example*: Remembering a visual event in black and white vs. color[^2]
- The submodalities we have a firm grasp on dramatically influence our emotions
and experiences
- Everyone has their own developed submodalities and they control our emotions.
    - A lack of submodalities means submodalities are not developed
    - Overdeveloped means past events are re-experienced clearly
- Controlling emotions mean recontextualizing submodalities.
Ask questions with a gentle curiousity.

!!! warning "On NLP"
    Note that this comes from NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming not
    Natural Language Processing), which, as wikipedia[^3] and others[^4]
    point out, is considered Pseudoscience.
