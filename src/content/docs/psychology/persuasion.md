## Classical Rhetoric

In *Rhetoric*, Aristotle proposes that persuasion rests on three pillars: **ethos** (credibility), **pathos** (emotional appeal), and **logos** (reason). These modes aren’t independent; effective communication balances them. Ethos anchors *trust*, pathos animates *motivation*, and logos provides *structure* and *coherence*.[^1]

### Applications

- In writing, presentations, or UX copy, *lead with ethos*: surface transparency, credentials, and shared values.
- Employ *pathos* through narrative and empathy—appeals to emotion strengthen recall and identification.
- Close with *logos*: present data, causal logic, or evidence that validates the emotional claim.
- Ethical persuasion demands alignment: emotions and facts must reinforce, not distort, one another.

### Design cue

Interfaces and products also persuade.
Visual clarity and brand integrity substitute for ethos; emotional tone in onboarding flows evokes pathos; clear navigation and consistent logic embody logos.

### Limitations

Aristotle offers a taxonomy, not an empirical model—use it to diagnose balance rather than predict success.

## Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)

Petty & Cacioppo (1986) frame persuasion as a continuum of cognitive effort.

- **Central route:** careful consideration of arguments—effective when the audience is motivated and able to think.
- **Peripheral route:** reliance on heuristics (credibility, attractiveness, repetition) when attention or ability is low.[^2]

Attitudes shaped through the central route are more durable and predictive of future behavior. Peripheral cues, however, are invaluable for low-engagement contexts.

### Design cue

- Evaluate the *stakes* and *mental bandwidth* of your audience. When motivation is high, foreground reasoning, transparency, and counter-arguments.
- When low, simplify: fluent design, social proof, authority cues.
- Consider “graduated depth”: peripheral entry points that open into central detail once curiosity activates.

### Limitations

Human reasoning rarely splits cleanly into routes; emotional and cognitive processing co-occur. Treat the ELM as a *lens* for adaptive message design, not a dichotomy.

## Narrative Transportation

Green & Brock (2000) show that being *immersed* in a story reduces counter-arguing and heightens belief acceptance. The more vividly a person imagines a narrative world, the more its lessons feel self-experienced.[^3]

### Design cue

- Tell stories with identifiable protagonists whose dilemmas echo your audience’s own.
- Ensure causal coherence—motives, conflicts, and outcomes must feel inevitable, not contrived.
- Use imagery and pacing to elicit *transportation*: focused attention, emotional engagement, and temporal absorption.

### Ethics

Transportation amplifies empathy but also vulnerability. In persuasive systems, use it to deepen understanding—not to bypass consent or informed judgment.

## Inoculation Theory

McGuire (1961) analogized resistance to persuasion with immunization: exposing people to a weakened counterargument plus a refutation builds cognitive “antibodies.”[^4]
The sequence: (1) warn of a forthcoming attack, (2) present mild opposing claims, (3) rebut them. The result is strengthened commitment and critical vigilance.

### Applications

- Integrate brief “pre-bunking” in misinformation or security education—show common fallacies, then correct them.
- Encourage users to *generate* their own counter-arguments; active defense increases resilience.
- Periodically “booster” messages to maintain protection over time.

### Limitations

If the threat is too weak, people ignore it; if too strong, they disengage. The art is proportionality—enough tension to trigger reflection without panic.
