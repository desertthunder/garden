title: Internal Family System's Therapy
---

- Internal Family Systems therapy's purpose is to empower us to find insights in
 to our own psychodynamics.
- Your parts are naturally endowed with qualities such as joy, freedom,
 perceptiveness, and creativity, but these have been lost because of childhood
  wounds.[^1]
- We build up protective, defensive parts of ourselves in response to trauma
and these don't serve us well as adults
