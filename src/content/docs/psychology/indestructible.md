- Kafka defines[^1] the indestructible as the place at the bottom of every individual
that keeps going whether they choose to or not.

!!!quote

    The indestructible is one: it is each individual human being and, at the
    same time, it is common to all, hence the incomparably indivisible
    union that exists between human beings.
