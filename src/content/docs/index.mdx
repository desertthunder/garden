<Aside type="caution" title="Currently Remodeling 🚧">
    I've very recently migrated this site from `mkdocs` to `astro/starlight`
    and am in the process of updating all of my notes. Please bear with me as
    some admonitions/callouts will be broken. You'll see a lot of `!!! info`,
    `!!! quote`, or `::: info`, `::: quote` etc. They'll be changed to be more
    like this block.

    Some links will also be broken.

Hi! My name is Owais and this is my digital garden. It's a collection of notes
I've taken on topics that interest me. This includes a lot of engineering and
programming notes that I've taken throughout my career and while working on
personal projects. My hope is that someone learns something new or finds some
wisdom that resonates with them.

Digital gardens have been fascinating for me for a long time. I miss the days
of stumbling upon [information on an odd personal site](https://tilde.town/~dozens/sofa/)
on the internet and want to be a part of bringing that back. I've tried keeping
gardens in various iterations with tools like notion and even google drive, but
nothing has been quite as consistent as a combination of some plaintext editor
(VSCode & now Neovim) or
"[Knowledge IDE](https://dev.to/envoy_/obsidian-an-ide-for-your-brain-1bn7)"
like Obsidian.

## Inspiration

Top of the list is definitely the [Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/).
After starting a new python project and activating my virtual environment, I
pretty much always install mkdocs with the material theme. That site, while also
having some fantastic information, reminded me that I can just use mkdocs.

Also, take a look at my notes on [cultivating](/garden/writing/cultivation) a garden.
