title: Internet Handle
---

Internet handle is a standalone article posted on [Internet Handle](https://internethandle.org/)

It describes the way AT protocol powered apps don't require you to "squat handles," but instead
give you the option of using your universal "internet handle," i.e. your domain name. This is
used by app's like [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/desertthunder.dev), [leaflet](https://desertthunder.leaflet.pub),
and [tangled](https://tangled.org/desertthunder.dev/).
