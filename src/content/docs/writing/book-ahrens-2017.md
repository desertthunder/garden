title: How to Take Smart Notes
---

- Two-Slip boxes in one markdown file: note and reference - notes extend and
relate to other notes, not in isolation (one note can exist in different
contexts - basically, we can understand how different ideas[^1])

- Read, Think, Understand - then write your note (woops) - we have to [write to externalize our ideas](./write_to_learn.md)
- Life requires context switching, and notes with an index can help me pick up where I left off in the thought process.
This is important for my work, as I am a knowledge worker
- Strip the workflow of everything that can be considered unimportant (I should probably stop using Notion for note taking - only as content management)
- The author advises that we always have the tools at hand - pen & paper (anything to capture with)
- A journal is a "graveyard for thoughts", the slip box should be for notes[^2]

- Asking yourself what you should learn is a useless question -
  it's easier to do things with a clear view of the destination
    - Deliberate practice helps us become better at making this journey[^3]

!!! quote

    Nothing counts other than writing.

- The main goal[^4] of notes is to convey the truth (publishable insight)
- Note types: Fleeting, Permanent, Project (-specific)
- In order to find a topic, you need to have studied a subject
    - This makes me think of an old interview of Alexisonfire, where George says
      to make music, you have to listen to music.

!!! quote
    By focusing on what is interesting and keeping written track of
    *your own intellectual development*, topics, questions and arguments will
    emerge from the material without force.

- Rewarding work starts the positive feedback loop
    - Writing provides the feedback portion
(we're forced to assess if we're understanding the material)
- [[Mere Exposure Effect]]:  If we do something a lot,
we *think* we're good at it, even if we're not
- Focused attention is not very long. New technology damages our ability to
practice sustained attention (where we work on one thing at a time)
- Creativity requires keeping an open mind and being able to switch
to a narrow, analytical approach
- Memo-ize memories - group in to bundles, rather than discrete facts
- "Mind Like Water" - get knowledge out of our short term memory

!!! question

    Who said the above quote?

- Willpower is like muscles - requires rest and gets exhausted quickly but can
be strengthened
- Hand writing facilitates understanding because it is slow - college students
have to understand what they hear rather than copy it down
- Shorter, in your own words allows us to focus on patterns, frames, and
categories of an excerpt
- Re-reading breeds familiarity, writing forces us to confront misunderstanding
- Cramming is for short term retention, not for learning
- The brain prioritizes comfort and its own happiness (like ego in The Power of Now)
    - Writing was Richard Feynman's thinking process (think outside your brain)

- Forgetting can sometimes be [[Active Inhibition|done by our minds]] as a
filter so we don't get flooded with memories and associations
(think join models in SQL)

- Memory can be measured by storage and retrieval strength
    - Storage strength can't be improved
- Linking is key!
    - Keep an eye towards other notes and contexts such that you can build the
matrix around things you're interested in

- Contradictions, paradoxes and problems help us reassess pre-existing
knowledge stored in the slip-box
(corrects for the [[Feature Positive Effect|feature-positive effect]])

- Remember that the slip-box is just a tool[^5]
- [[Worldly Wisdom|Worldly Wisdom]]: hanging life experiences on mental models
- Spaced repitition and active recall are important for information retention.

- One idea per permanent note - place limits so that they stay concise.
    - Structure (experiment) and restrictions (assess what is important)
are necessary for creativity

- The brain prioritizes information that is recently acquired and with
emotions attached to it
- Evolution works by trial & error, not planning[^6]

- [[Motivation when Studying|Motivation]] is relational (students must
  identify with and see the purpose of their work)
    - And be [[Autonomy in Work|free]]

- Athletes are more motivated when they imagine the training it takes to
win.[^7] How can I implement this?
- Build new habits to replace old ones, don't force old habits away
    - The [[Goal of Learning|goal of learning]] is to evolve

## My Routine/Takeaways

- Keep a pen & paper handy at all times (if anything, just to avoid opening
your phone when in the middle of a book)
- Abandon the notion of making perfect notes. Do you think the multicolored
shit people made in college is something that would have helped you? Why not
just make art instead?
- When processing notes, open up the source with anything you've highlighted
    - *ex. the Kindle notes & highlights for this book*
- Many of my attitudes towards learning are not conducive to learning, but to
accomplishing a very specific task.
- Turn the writing everything and thinking about process in to a
[[Motivation when Studying|hobby]].
