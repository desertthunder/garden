title:  Stacks, Queues, and Abstract Data Types
---

- Abstract data types are sets of theoretical rules that revolve
around some built-in data structure.
- Arrays with restrictions related to order.[^1]

## Stacks

- Data can only be added (*push*), removed (*pop*), and read (*peek*)
from the top of the stack (i.e. end of the array)
- Stacks are last in first out (LIFO), whereas queues are first in
first out (FIFO).

## Queues

- Data can be added to the end (*push/enqueue*). It can be read and
removed from the beginning (*peek* and *dequeued*)
- Queues are great for handling asynchronous processes.
